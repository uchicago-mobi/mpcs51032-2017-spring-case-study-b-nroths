# algolia-firebase-cloud-functions
This is an example of keeping a Firebase Database in-sync with an Algolia index using Google Cloud Functions

## Deploy Google Cloud Function
How to use:

1) Install firebase cli (requires npm and node.js, more instructions here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)

```$ npm install -g firebase-tools```

2) Install node packages

```$ npm install```

3) add your algolia credentials to your firebase function.  This will save the credentials as environment variables that can be used in the function

```$ firebase functions:config:set algolia.app_id="APPID" algolia.api_key="API_KEY"```

4) edit index.js with the Algolia index name you would like to publish to and also the url in firebase you would like to monitor (line 7 and 9)

5) Deploy the firebase functions 

```$ firebase deploy --only functions```


## Backfill your data
In some cases you might already have existing data in firebase that you would like to sync to algolia or would like to re-sync your database.  In this case I provided a backfill.js file that will transfer all the current data to algolia.

How to use:
1) Open backfill.js
2) Fill in the following values:
- ALGOLIA_APP_ID
- ALGOLIA_API_KEY
- ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME
- path/to/service/account.json (these are your credntials to your firebase database.  You can generate a private key by going to Project Settings -> Service Accounts -> Firebase Admin SDK) on the firebase webpage
- FIREBASE_URL
- FIREBASE_ITEM_NAME
3) run the script by doing
``$ node backfill.js``
